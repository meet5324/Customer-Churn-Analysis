# Customer-Churn-Analysis
ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Analysis
This project explores customer churn patterns using count plots and stacked bar charts. Key service features like Internet Type, Tech Support, and Streaming are analyzed to identify churn trends.

Findings show that customers without Tech Support, Online Security, or Backup are more likely to churn. Fiber optic users and those with multiple lines also show higher churn rates.

Visualizations are grouped for easy comparison across features using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

The goal is to help stakeholders understand where churn is concentrated and inform retention strategies.
